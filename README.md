# RNA-sequence-analysis
Overview
This document presents an analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data using bioinformatics tools. The goal is to preprocess, analyze, and interpret gene expression data, identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and potential biological insights.

Key Sections
Data Preprocessing & Quality Control

Raw RNA-Seq reads processing
Quality filtering and trimming
Alignment to reference genome
Read Quantification & Normalization

Gene expression quantification using kallisto
Normalization of expression values
Differential Gene Expression Analysis

Statistical tests to identify DEGs
Volcano plots and MA plots for visualization
Functional Enrichment Analysis

Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis
Biological interpretation of significant genes
Visualization & Results Interpretation

Heatmaps and PCA plots
Clustering of gene expression patterns
Tools & Commands Used
Software: kallisto, R (DESeq2, edgeR, ggplot2), FastQC, MultiQC
Commands:
kallisto quant for transcript quantification
DESeq2 for differential expression analysis
ggplot2 for data visualization
Key Findings
Identified significant DEGs related to key biological processes.
Performed pathway analysis to determine functional roles.
Ensured high data quality through rigorous QC checks.
